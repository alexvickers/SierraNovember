        I'm a frontend developer with over a decade of experience building fast,
        accessible websites. I specialize in WordPress, headless builds with
        Next.js, and design system development.

      <p>
        I’m also an English teacher, vinyl collector, writer, amateur musician,
        and big believer in São Paulo being the most incredible city on Earth.
        Whether I’m writing code, teaching, or covering shows for Underfloripa,
        I care about rhythm, clarity, and structure.
