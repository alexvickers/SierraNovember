        I'm a frontend developer with over a decade of experience building fast,
        accessible websites. I specialize in WordPress, headless builds with
        Next.js, and design system development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m also an English teacher, vinyl collector, music writer, and big
        believer in SÃ£o Paulo being the most incredible city on Earth. Whether
        Iâ€™m writing code, teaching, or covering indie shows for Underfloripa, I
        care about rhythm, clarity, and structure.
