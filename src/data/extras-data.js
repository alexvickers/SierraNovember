    label: "This Must Be the Place (for Music)",
    description:
      "I play guitar and bass, and I'm taking singing lessons to round out the noise. My record collection is always growing — from post-rock textures and shoegaze walls of sound to Brazilian 70s psychedelia and metal classics. My prized possession is a German reissue of My Bloody Valentine's *Loveless*. I also write concert reviews for Underfloripa, which lets me blend my ear for detail with my love of storytelling.",

    label: "The Book(s) I Read",
    description:
      "I'm studying English Language and Literature at the University of São Paulo (USP), where I dive into critical theory, short stories, and cultural analysis. I've written essays on everything from Krautrock to 20th-century American fiction, and I'm preparing my bachelor's thesis on Radiohead's *Hail to the Thief*. Cultural Studies is where I sharpen both my critical voice and my curiosity.",

    label: "Speaking in Tongues",
    description:
      "Languages open doors. I speak English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Italian, and I've dabbled in German and Dutch. Right now, I'm running a project teaching English to fellow software developers — bridging communication gaps in tech the same way I bridge them in code. Multilingualism keeps me grounded in both local cultures and global conversations.",

    label: "Nothing But Flowers and Street Gaps",
    description:
      "São Paulo is my playground and muse. I skate (when my knees allow it), hunt down the best street food, and take photos of architecture, graffiti, and whatever catches my eye. For me, the city isn't just where I live — it's a constantly shifting story that I read every time I step outside.",

  {
    label: "Found a Job (in Code)",
    description:
      "I've been a frontend developer for over a decade, building custom WordPress sites, headless CMS projects, and design systems. I think of code as Lego blocks — reusable, fun, and full of possibility. I've led migrations from legacy servers, improved SEO and performance scores, mentored junior devs, and collaborated with designers to bridge the gap between vision and execution.",

  {
    label: "Once in a Lifetime (Writing)",
    description:
      "Writing ties it all together — whether it's documenting code, publishing essays, or reviewing concerts. I contribute to Under Floripa, an independent magazine focused on music and culture, and I've been part of a university extension project to create a student magazine. Words help me connect ideas across tech, art, and life.",

    label: "Take a Picture, Here's Your Receipt",
    description:
      "I'm rarely without a camera in hand (or phone at the ready). From São Paulo street corners to concert pits, I love capturing moments that tell their own story. Photography is how I slow down, frame the chaos, and notice the beauty hiding in everyday life.",

  {
    label: "Stay Up Late (Family)",
    description:
      "I'm married and the proud dad of a daughter, who's learning guitar just like her old man. Sharing music, movies, and stories with her keeps me grounded — and reminds me that creativity isn't just about personal expression, but about what you pass on.",
