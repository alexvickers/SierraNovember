    description:
      "I spent a semester in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, diving into English and American Literature at Radboud University. Between pondering Matthew Gregory Lewis and analyzing Batman (yes, really), I joined the Study Association, swapped cultural references with classmates from across the globe, and developed a deep, borderline unhealthy love for late-night frikandel at Phebo. Oh, and there were karaoke nights at Roxy's, pints at Tierney's, and a whole lot of biking thrown in there too — because, obviously.",

    description:
      "I kicked off my Letters degree at the University of São Paulo right in the middle of the pandemic. First year? All Google Meets, all the time — yes, I became very familiar with the dreaded Zoom fatigue. Pamela? Still not my friend. But once campus life kicked in in 2022, I dove headfirst into English Language and Literature, attended an absurd amount of parties (about three), and made some lifelong friends. The bus ride to campus was an endless battle, but caffeine-powered, I triumphed through every single reading.",

    description: "In February 2012, my life got a little more chaotic in the best possible way — Rebecca was born. Suddenly, I was navigating sleepless nights, diaper duty, and a new level of love I didn't know existed. It was like being handed the most adorable, high-maintenance puzzle. Spoiler: I’m still working on solving it, but every moment’s been worth it. Also, I learned to appreciate coffee on a whole new level.",

    description: "July 2021 — the day I rolled up my sleeve and joined the global vaccination club. My first shot, and honestly, it felt like a milestone. A little needle, a lot of hope. The side effects? A sore arm and a sudden obsession with checking my ‘vaccine passport.’ I celebrated with a weird mix of relief and 'I’ve survived 2020' pride. It was the first step toward normal, or at least a new version of normal with less mask-wearing.",

    description: "In March 2010, I began my Graphic Design degree at UFSC — back when classes happened in actual classrooms, critiques were face-to-face, and pulling all-nighters to meet deadlines was practically a rite of passage. Between Illustrator crashes, caffeine-fueled work sessions, and enough printing drama to last a lifetime, I learned the fundamentals of design the old-school way. Also: plenty of parties, questionable group projects, and a few unforgettable professors along the way.",
