    title: "Travelled to The Netherlands",
    description: "I spent a semester in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, studying English and American Literature at Radboud University. Between deep dives into Matthew Gregory Lewis and Batman, I joined events from the Study Association, swapped cultural references with classmates from all over the world, and developed a real fondness for stroopwafels and late-night Frikandel at the Phebo. Also: karaoke nights at Roxy's, pints at Tierney's, and a whole lot of biking in between.",

    title: "Started Studying Letters at USP",
    description: "I started my degree in Letters at the University of São Paulo right in the thick of the pandemic — first year entirely online, Zoom fatigue and all. I immediately hated Pamela (a classic text that still haunts me). Once campus life kicked in in 2022, I dove into English Language and Literature, attended too many parties, and made some great friends. The bus ride to campus was always a hassle, but I powered through it — fueled by an obscene amount of coffee every night to keep up with the readings.",
