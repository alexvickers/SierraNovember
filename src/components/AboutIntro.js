        I'm a frontend developer with over a decade of experience turning design into
        fast, accessible, and expressive websites. I live at the crossroads of
        WordPress, headless builds with Next.js, and design systems that actually
        make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m also an English teacher, amateur musician, vinyl hoarder, and a
        writer/photographer for <em>Under Floripa</em>. I believe good code has rhythm, a killer
        sentence is like a well-placed guitar solo, and São Paulo is the most
        electrifying city on the planet. I like my interfaces like I like my records:
        clean, bold, and full of texture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether I’m designing components, teaching conditionals, or reviewing a
        hardcore gig in a sweaty club, I bring the same love for structure, flow, and
        impact. I build things that move — on screen, on stage, and in people’s
        heads.
